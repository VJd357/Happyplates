        Extract comprehensive menu information in JSON format from the given complete menu image.
        The output JSON should be structured to include multiple sections, each with its own item type and corresponding items. Each section should be represented as follows:
        - "item_type": The heading of the section, representing the category of items.
        - "items": A list of items within this section, where each item contains:
          - "item_name": The name of the item.
          - "item_description": A detailed description of the item, if available.
          - "item_price": The price of the item, if listed.
          - "item_portion": The portion size of the item, if mentioned.

        The JSON should be organized to facilitate easy conversion into a DataFrame format, allowing for clear differentiation between sections and their respective items.
